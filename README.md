# 🚘 AI-Powered Traffic Reporter with CarPlay Integration

## 📍 Overview
This project aims to build a real-time traffic reporting system that uses automation and AI to detect and report incidents such as speed traps, accidents, and road hazards. It integrates:
- APIs from **Google Maps**, **Apple Maps**, and **Waze**
- An **LLM-based automated agent** to simulate user reports
- A user-friendly interface for manual incident reporting
- Optional **Apple CarPlay integration** for safe, in-vehicle use

> **Development Timeline:** May 19 – August 19, 2025

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native or SwiftUI
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask) or Node.js
- **AI Agent:** OpenAI API / LangChain
- **Maps & Traffic APIs:** Google Maps SDK, Apple MapKit, Waze SDK
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based (TBD)
- **Integration Target:** Apple CarPlay

## 🧠 Learning Tracks (via IBM Interskill)
To support development, the following courses are being taken:
- Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics
- Cloud Computing
- Python Programming
- DevOps and Agile
- Containers

## 🚧 Milestones
